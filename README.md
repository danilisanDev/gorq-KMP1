(Before this project, my previous experience with Android development was Java and xml.)

### THE PROJECT

What started as a Kotlin/Jetpack Compose Multiplatform project whose main target was learning about promising new technologies ended up with a simple yet fully playable game about arithmetics.

### WHAT I INTENDED

Developing an original game with easy rules which could be explained through the UI design and animations with as little text as possible.

### WHAT I HAVE LEARNED

1.	**Kotlin (Multiplatform)** as domain language.
2.	**Jetpack Compose (Multiplatform)** for UI design.
3.	**Coroutines & StateFlow** for asynchronous programming.
4.	**Koin** for Dependency Injection.
5.	**[Settings](https://github.com/russhwolf/multiplatform-settings) & Kotlinx Serialization** for persistence.
6.	**[Napier](https://github.com/AAkira/Napier)** for debug/logging.

### WHAT NEXT
- Instructions in-game.
- Online scoreboard.
- Sound effects.
- Time trial game mode.
- More game modes.
